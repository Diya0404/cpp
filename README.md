Player positions: The player_positions vector now stores the positions of both players, with player 1 at index 0 and player 2 at index 1.
Game loop: The game loop now iterates over both players, allowing each player to take a turn.
Player identification: The code now identifies the current player using the loop index (0 for player 1, 1 for player 2) and displays the appropriate messages.
Win condition: The game continues until one of the players reaches the end of the board (position 100). When a player wins, the game ends, and a congratulatory message is displayed.
To run the game, create an instance of the SnakeAndLadder class in the main function and call the play member function. The game will prompt each player to press Enter to roll the dice and move forward. The players take turns until one of them reaches the end of the board and wins the game.
This enhanced version of the code allows two players to compete against each other in the Snake and Ladder game, adding more excitement and interaction to the gameplay.
